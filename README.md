# Machine Learning Tutorials
## Description
Machine learning tutorials I have completed so far includes a tutorial on `Iris` dataset as well as `MNIST-Digits` dataset. Featuring linear and logisitic regression as well as a very basic generative adversarial network. For the `MNIST-Digits` Scroll all the way to the bottom using the scroll bar on the right in order to get past all the training updates and see the generated digits.
